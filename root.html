						<span class='scoundrel'>When you <strong>wreck something</strong> with flagrantly dangerous means (explosives, uncontrolled flame, etc.), roll with Luck instead of Might.</span>
						<span class='thief'>When you <strong>attempt roguish feats</strong> to get into or out of a place you’ve previously been, you can mark exhaustion to make the move as if you had rolled a 10+, instead of rolling.</span>
						<span class='tinker'>You have a kit of tools and supplies with which you work on long-term projects. Choose two features:
							<i>assorted scrap wood, assorted gears and springs, esoteric hand tools, manuals, assorted medicines, portable alchemy kit, sewing kit, cookware, minor explosives</i>
							Choose one drawback:
							<i>heavy (counts as 2 Load instead of 1), bulky & obvious, stolen, fragile</i>
						When you <strong>open up your toolkit and dedicate yourself to making a thing or to getting to the bottom of something</strong>, decide what and tell the GM. The GM will give you between 1 to 4 conditions you must fulfill to accomplish your goal, including time taken, materials needed, help needed, facilities/tools needed, or the limits on the project.

						<span class='vagrant'>When you <strong>trick an NPC</strong> into fighting another NPC, you can remove one option from the 7-9 list—they cannot choose that option instead of doing what you want.</span>

						<span class='adventurer'>When you aim to <strong>subdue an enemy quickly and nonlethally</strong>, you can <strong>engage in melee</strong> with Cunning instead of Might. You cannot choose to inflict serious harm if you do.</span>
						<span class='arbiter'>When you <strong>use words to pause an argument or violent conflict between others</strong>, roll with Charm. On a hit, they choose: mark 2 exhaustion and  keep going, or stop for now. On a 10+, take +1 ongoing to dealing with them peacefully. On a miss, NPCs turn their anger to you, and PCs take +1 ongoing against you for the scene.</span>
						<span class='harrier'>Take +1 Finesse (max +3).</span>
						<span class='ranger'>When you <strong>take advantage of an opening to escape from a dangerous situation</strong>, roll with Finesse. On a hit, you get away. On a 10+, choose 1. On a 7-9, choose 2:
							<ul>
								<li>You suffer injury or exhaustion (GM’s choice) during your escape</li>
								<li>You end up in another dangerous situation</li>
								<li>You leave something important behind</li>
							</ul>
						On a miss, you escape, but it costs you—mark injury or exhaustion, GM’s choice—and you leave ample evidence behind for your foes to track and follow you.</span>
						<span class='ronin'>When you <strong>figure out</strong> a denizen of status, authority, or power, roll with Might instead of Charm. When you trick a denizen of status, authority, or power by playing subordinate, roll with Might instead of Cunning.</span>
						<span class='scoundrel'>When you <strong>use available materials to rig up a dangerous device</strong>, roll with Finesse. On a hit, you cobble together something that will do what you want, one time. On a 10+, choose one. On a 7-9, choose two. The device is:
							<ul>
								<li>more dangerous than intended</li>
								<li>larger or more unwieldy than intended</li>
								<li>more temperamental and fragile than intended</li>
							</ul>
						On a miss, you need some vital component to finish it; the GM will tell you what.</span>
						<span class='thief'>When you <strong>slip into shadows while unnoticed</strong>, mark exhaustion and hold 1. As long as you remain quiet, move slowly, and hold 1 for this move, you will remain hidden. If you inadvertently reveal yourself, lose your hold. Spend your hold to reveal yourself from a darkened place, suddenly and without warning. If you attack someone immediately after spending the hold, take +3 on the roll.</span>
						<span class='tinker'>When you <strong>repair destroyed personal equipment with your toolbox</strong>, the GM will set one condition as per the toolbox move. Fulfill it, and clear all wear for that equipment. When you <strong>repair damaged personal equipment with your toolkit</strong>, you do it as long as you spend depletion or value, 1 for 1, for each box of wear you clear.</span>
						<span class='vagrant'>When you <strong>suck up to or otherwise butter up an unsuspecting NPC</strong>, roll with Charm. On a 10+, hold 3. On a 7-9, hold 2. Spend your hold 1 for 1 to deflect their suspicion or aggression away from you onto someone or something else. On a miss, your attempts at flattery are suspicious—they’re going to keep their eye on you.</span>

							When you <strong>gather information about the goings-on in a clearing</strong>, roll with Cunning. On a 10+, ask 3. On a 7-9, ask 2.
							<ul>
								<li>Who holds power in this clearing?</li>
								<li>Who is the local dissident?</li>
								<li>What are the denizens afraid of?</li>
								<li>What do the denizens hope for?</li>
								<li>What opportunities exist for enterprising vagabonds?</li>
							</ul>
							On a miss, your questions tip off someone dangerous.
						</span>
						<span class='arbiter'>When you <strong>smash your way through scenery to reach someone or something</strong>, roll with Might. On a hit, you reach your target. On a 10+, choose 1. On a 7–9, choose 2.
							<ul>
								<li>You hurt yourself: mark 1 injury</li>
								<li>You break an important part of your surroundings</li>
								<li>You damage or leave behind a piece of gear (GM’s choice)</li>
							</ul>
						On a miss, you smash through, but you leave yourself totally vulnerable on the other side.</span>
						<span class='harrier'>Take the <i>Counterfeit</i> roguish feat. (It does not count against your maximum.) When you pretend to be an innocuous messenger carrying a missive of import to <strong>trick</strong> someone, roll with Luck instead of Cunning.</span>
						<span class='ranger'>You have expertise in the poisons and antidotes of the Woodland. When you <strong>brew a poison</strong>, mark depletion and say what effect you want it to have: sleep, weakness, inebriation, or death. Any poison you make requires ingestion or injection; you can use the poison on your weapon or put it in your target’s food or drink. When you study a poison or its effects to make an antidote, the GM will tell you what special ingredient you’ll need. Get the ingredient and mark 1 depletion to brew the antidote.</span>
						<span class='ronin'>When you <strong>enter a social environment dependent on manners and etiquette</strong>, roll with Cunning. On a 10+, hold 3. On a 7-9, hold 2. Lose all hold when you leave or when social rules fall apart. Spend hold 1-for-1 to:
							<ul>
								<li>Cover up a social faux pas on behalf of you or an ally; clear 1 exhaustion.</li>
								<li>Call out someone else’s social faux pas; inflict 1-morale harm on them.</li>
								<li>Charm someone; take +1 ongoing to speak to them while you have hold.</li>
								<li>Demonstrate your value; mark prestige with a powerful denizen’s faction.</li>
							</ul>
						On a miss, the rules of etiquette here are far different from what you expected; mark exhaustion as you commit a gravely impolite error.</span>
						<span class='scoundrel'>You gain the roguish feat <i>Blindside</i> (it does not count against your maximum for advancement). When you <strong>attempt a roguish feat</strong> to blindside someone while they are distracted by environmental dangers (a raging fire, an oncoming flood, etc.), roll with Luck instead of Cunning.</span>
						<span class='thief'>When you <strong>evade and dodge your enemy so as to tire them out</strong>, roll with Finesse. On a hit, you can mark exhaustion to make them mark 2-exhaustion. On a 10+, you can mark exhaustion to make them mark 3-exhaustion. On a miss, they catch you in the middle of a dodge—you’re at their mercy.</span>
						<span class='tinker'>Take two extra boxes of depletion.</span>
						<span class='vagrant'>When you <strong>trust fate</strong> to see you through by begging, pleading, or abasing
						yourself, roll with Charm instead of Luck.</span>

							When you <strong>give a speech to interested denizens of a clearing</strong>, say what you are motivating them to do and roll with Charm. On a hit, they will move to do it as they see fit. On a 10+, choose 2. On a 7-9, choose 1.
							<ul>
								<li>They don’t try to take your intent too far</li>
								<li>They don’t disband at the first sign of real resistance</li>
								<li>They don’t demand you stand at their head and lead</li>
							</ul>
							On a miss, they twist your message in unpredictable ways.
						</span>
						<span class='arbiter'>Take 1 additional injury boxes. Whenever time passes or you journey to a new clearing, you can clear 2 injury boxes automatically.</span>
						<span class='harrier'>When you <strong>dash your way through a chaotic scene or fight</strong>, roll with Finesse. On a 10+, hold 3. On a 7-9, hold 2. Spend your hold 1-for-1 to dash to something within sight and reach without being stopped, or to dash away from something nearby without being stopped. You can dash away from an enemy even at the moment they attack. On a miss, your surroundings trip you up, and you’re caught in place while danger closes in.</span>
						<span class='ranger'>When you <strong>travel or pass into a forest</strong>, before making any travel move, you can clear your choice of:
							<ul>
								<li>Up to 3-depletion</li>
								<li>Up to 2-exhaustion</li>
								<li>Up to 2-injury</li>
							</ul>
						</span>
						<span class='ronin'>When you <strong>commit yourself to the cause of someone you deem worthy</strong>, swear an oath to them stating what task you will complete on their behalf. Mark exhaustion to reroll a move made in pursuit of that task. You cannot commit yourself to another cause until you accomplish the first, or break your oath. If you break your oath, fill your exhaustion track and mark 4 notoriety with the faction whose trust you betrayed. If you fulfill your oath, mark 4 prestige with the faction whose trust you kept.</span>
						<span class='scoundrel'>You’re at your luckiest when you go into danger without hesitation. When you <strong>dive into a dangerous situation without forethought or planning</strong>, treat yourself as having “Luck Armor,” with 1 box of wear (remember, armor is only “destroyed” when you would mark another box of wear, and all its boxes are full). The “Luck armor” automatically goes away once the danger has passed, and the next time you would have “Luck armor,” you gain it as if it was brand new with clear boxes.</span>
						<span class='thief'>When you <strong>grapple</strong> with an enemy larger than you, roll with Finesse instead of Might. On a miss, they overpower you—you’re at their mercy.</span>
						<span class='tinker'>When you <strong>create a makeshift device on the fly</strong>, roll with Cunning. On a hit, you create a device that works once, then breaks. On a 10+, choose one:
							<ul>
								<li>It works exceptionally well</li>
								<li>You get an additional use out of it</li>
							</ul>
						On a miss, the device works, but it has an unintended side effect that the GM will reveal when you use it.</span>
						<span class='vagrant'>When you <strong>play upon an enemy’s insecurities, concerns, or fears to distract them with words during a fight</strong>, roll with Cunning. On a hit, you create an opening for yourself—make any available weapon move against them at +1, or strike quickly and deal injury to them. On a 7-9, you also tick them off; they aren’t listening to you anymore, no matter what you do, until the situation drastically changes. On a miss, you infuriate them—they come at you, hard, and you’re not prepared.</span>

						<span class='harrier'>When you <strong>travel along the paths to another clearing</strong>, you can always give +1 to the roll or clear 2-exhaustion, your choice. When you <strong>travel through the forest to another clearing</strong>, you can always give +1 to the roll or clear 2-depletion, your choice.

						<span class='ranger'>When you <strong>persuade an NPC with open threats or naked steel</strong>, roll with Might instead of Charm.</span>
						<span class='ronin'>When you <strong>call upon a reasonable foe to uphold a rule of war</strong>, roll with Might. On a hit, they feel obliged; choose one below they must follow. On a 7-9, they choose one that you must follow; disobey, and the obligation ends.
							<ul>
								<li>Show mercy to surrendering foes and prisoners</li>
								<li>Refrain from underhanded tactics in a fight</li>

						On a miss, they feel no obligation to your ideas of war; prepare for a brutal lesson in the rules they adhere to.</span>
						<span class='scoundrel'>You have a mask or outfit you wear when you go about your most destructive work—more of a calling card, an identifier of “the real you,” than a disguise. Treat it as a piece of equipment with two boxes of wear. While you have your mask on, any notoriety you gain is doubled, any prestige you gain is halved, and take +1 to <strong>trust fate</strong> and all Scoundrel playbook moves. If your mask is ever taken from you, mark exhaustion. If your mask is ever destroyed, mark 4-exhaustion. If your mask is destroyed, you can make a new mask when time passes.</span>
						<span class='thief'>Take +1 Finesse (max +3).</span>
						<span class='tinker'>When you <strong>attempt roguish feats</strong> involving mechanisms or locks, mark depletion to roll with Cunning instead of Finesse.</span>
						<span class='vagrant'>When you <strong>play a game of skill and wit to loosen another’s tongue</strong>, roll with Charm. On a hit, they let slip something useful or valuable. On a 7-9, you have to lose the game to get them there; mark one depletion. On a miss, they’re better than you ever thought; either mark one depletion and cut your losses, or mark three depletion and they’ll start talking.</span>

						<span class='adventurer'>When you <strong>try to befriend an NPC you’ve just met by matching their personality, body language, and desires</strong>, mark exhaustion and roll with Cunning. On a hit, they’ll look upon you favorably—ask them any one noncompromising question and they’ll answer truthfully, or request a simple favor and they’ll do it for you. On a 10+, they really like you—they’ll share a valuable secret or grant you a serious favor instead. On a miss, you read them totally wrong, and their displeasure costs you.</span>
						<span class='arbiter'>When you <strong>defend someone or something from an immediate NPC or environmental threat</strong>, roll with Might. On a hit, you keep them safe and choose one. On a 7–9, it costs: expose yourself to danger or escalate the situation.
							<ul>
								<li>Draw the attention of the threat; they focus on you now.</li>
								<li>Put the threat in a vulnerable spot; take +1 forward to counterstrike.</li>
								<li>Push the threat back; you and your protectee have a chance to maneuver or flee.</li>
							</ul>
						On a miss, you take the full brunt of the blow intended for your protectee, and the threat has you where it wants you.</span>
						<span class='harrier'>You’ve got a good sense for finding secret paths and doors. When you <strong>spend time looking for a secret way in or out of a place that might have one</strong>, mark exhaustion and roll with Luck. On a hit, you find a hidden path—the GM will detail it and to where it leads. On a 10+, there’s something along or inside the path of value to you—the GM will tell you what. On a miss, you find a secret path...and someone else is using it right this second. They probably won’t be happy you found their secret.</span>
						<span class='ranger'>Take two of the following weapon skills: <i>Trick Shot, Confuse Senses, Improvise Weapon, Disarm, Vicious Strike</i>. None of the skills you take with this move count against your maximum for advancement.</span>

						When you <strong>open up your toolkit and dedicate yourself to making a thing or to getting to the bottom of something</strong>, decide what and tell the GM. The GM will give you between 1 to 4 conditions you must fulfill to accomplish your goal, including time taken, materials needed, help needed, facilities/tools needed, or the limits on the project. When you <strong>accomplish the conditions</strong>, you accomplish the goal.</span>
						<span class='instigate'>When you <strong>trick an NPC</strong> into fighting another NPC, you can remove one option from the 7-9 list—they cannot choose that option instead of doing what you want.</span>						
						<span class='subdue'>When you aim to <strong>subdue an enemy quickly and nonlethally</strong>, you can <strong>engage in melee</strong> with Cunning instead of Might. You cannot choose to inflict serious harm if you do.</span>
						<span class='bigstick'>When you <strong>use words to pause an argument or violent conflict between others</strong>, roll with Charm. On a hit, they choose: mark 2 exhaustion and  keep going, or stop for now. On a 10+, take +1 ongoing to dealing with them peacefully. On a miss, NPCs turn their anger to you, and PCs take +1 ongoing against you for the scene.</span>
						<span class='fleet'>Take +1 Finesse (max +3).</span>
						<span class='slip'>When you <strong>take advantage of an opening to escape from a dangerous situation</strong>, roll with Finesse. On a hit, you get away. On a 10+, choose 1. On a 7-9, choose 2:
							<ul>
								<li>You suffer injury or exhaustion (GM’s choice) during your escape</li>
								<li>You end up in another dangerous situation</li>
								<li>You leave something important behind</li>
							</ul>
						On a miss, you escape, but it costs you—mark injury or exhaustion, GM’s choice—and you leave ample evidence behind for your foes to track and follow you.</span>
						<span class='lordwill'>When you <strong>figure out</strong> a denizen of status, authority, or power, roll with Might instead of Charm. When you trick a denizen of status, authority, or power by playing subordinate, roll with Might instead of Cunning.</span>
						<span class='createdestroy'>When you <strong>use available materials to rig up a dangerous device</strong>, roll with Finesse. On a hit, you cobble together something that will do what you want, one time. On a 10+, choose one. On a 7-9, choose two. The device is:
							<ul>
								<li>more dangerous than intended</li>
								<li>larger or more unwieldy than intended</li>
								<li>more temperamental and fragile than intended</li>
							</ul>
						On a miss, you need some vital component to finish it; the GM will tell you what.</span>
						<span class='disappear'>When you <strong>slip into shadows while unnoticed</strong>, mark exhaustion and hold 1. As long as you remain quiet, move slowly, and hold 1 for this move, you will remain hidden. If you inadvertently reveal yourself, lose your hold. Spend your hold to reveal yourself from a darkened place, suddenly and without warning. If you attack someone immediately after spending the hold, take +3 on the roll.</span>
						<span class='repair'>When you <strong>repair destroyed personal equipment with your toolbox</strong>, the GM will set one condition as per the toolbox move. Fulfill it, and clear all wear for that equipment. When you <strong>repair damaged personal equipment with your toolkit</strong>, you do it as long as you spend depletion or value, 1 for 1, for each box of wear you clear.</span>
						<span class='facade'>When you <strong>suck up to or otherwise butter up an unsuspecting NPC</strong>, roll with Charm. On a 10+, hold 3. On a 7-9, hold 2. Spend your hold 1 for 1 to deflect their suspicion or aggression away from you onto someone or something else. On a miss, your attempts at flattery are suspicious—they’re going to keep their eye on you.</span>						
						<span class='talon'>
							When you <strong>gather information about the goings-on in a clearing</strong>, roll with Cunning. On a 10+, ask 3. On a 7-9, ask 2.
							<ul>
								<li>Who holds power in this clearing?</li>
								<li>Who is the local dissident?</li>
								<li>What are the denizens afraid of?</li>
								<li>What do the denizens hope for?</li>
								<li>What opportunities exist for enterprising vagabonds?</li>
							</ul>
							On a miss, your questions tip off someone dangerous.
						</span>
						<span class='crash'>When you <strong>smash your way through scenery to reach someone or something</strong>, roll with Might. On a hit, you reach your target. On a 10+, choose 1. On a 7–9, choose 2.
							<ul>
								<li>You hurt yourself: mark 1 injury</li>
								<li>You break an important part of your surroundings</li>
								<li>You damage or leave behind a piece of gear (GM’s choice)</li>
							</ul>
						On a miss, you smash through, but you leave yourself totally vulnerable on the other side.</span>
						<span class='messenger'>Take the <i>Counterfeit</i> roguish feat. (It does not count against your maximum.) When you pretend to be an innocuous messenger carrying a missive of import to <strong>trick</strong> someone, roll with Luck instead of Cunning.</span>
						<span class='poison'>You have expertise in the poisons and antidotes of the Woodland. When you <strong>brew a poison</strong>, mark depletion and say what effect you want it to have: sleep, weakness, inebriation, or death. Any poison you make requires ingestion or injection; you can use the poison on your weapon or put it in your target’s food or drink. When you study a poison or its effects to make an antidote, the GM will tell you what special ingredient you’ll need. Get the ingredient and mark 1 depletion to brew the antidote.</span>
						<span class='mannered'>When you <strong>enter a social environment dependent on manners and etiquette</strong>, roll with Cunning. On a 10+, hold 3. On a 7-9, hold 2. Lose all hold when you leave or when social rules fall apart. Spend hold 1-for-1 to:
							<ul>
								<li>Cover up a social faux pas on behalf of you or an ally; clear 1 exhaustion.</li>
								<li>Call out someone else’s social faux pas; inflict 1-morale harm on them.</li>
								<li>Charm someone; take +1 ongoing to speak to them while you have hold.</li>
								<li>Demonstrate your value; mark prestige with a powerful denizen’s faction.</li>
							</ul>
						On a miss, the rules of etiquette here are far different from what you expected; mark exhaustion as you commit a gravely impolite error.</span>
						<span class='distraction'>You gain the roguish feat <i>Blindside</i> (it does not count against your maximum for advancement). When you <strong>attempt a roguish feat</strong> to blindside someone while they are distracted by environmental dangers (a raging fire, an oncoming flood, etc.), roll with Luck instead of Cunning.</span>
						<span class='rope'>When you <strong>evade and dodge your enemy so as to tire them out</strong>, roll with Finesse. On a hit, you can mark exhaustion to make them mark 2-exhaustion. On a 10+, you can mark exhaustion to make them mark 3-exhaustion. On a miss, they catch you in the middle of a dodge—you’re at their mercy.</span>
						<span class='pockets'>Take two extra boxes of depletion.</span>
						<span class='smile'>When you <strong>trust fate</strong> to see you through by begging, pleading, or abasing
						yourself, roll with Charm instead of Luck.</span>						
						<span class='orator'>
							When you <strong>give a speech to interested denizens of a clearing</strong>, say what you are motivating them to do and roll with Charm. On a hit, they will move to do it as they see fit. On a 10+, choose 2. On a 7-9, choose 1.
							<ul>
								<li>They don’t try to take your intent too far</li>
								<li>They don’t disband at the first sign of real resistance</li>
								<li>They don’t demand you stand at their head and lead</li>
							</ul>
							On a miss, they twist your message in unpredictable ways.
						</span>
						<span class='hardy'>Take 1 additional injury boxes. Whenever time passes or you journey to a new clearing, you can clear 2 injury boxes automatically.</span>
						<span class='parkour'>When you <strong>dash your way through a chaotic scene or fight</strong>, roll with Finesse. On a 10+, hold 3. On a 7-9, hold 2. Spend your hold 1-for-1 to dash to something within sight and reach without being stopped, or to dash away from something nearby without being stopped. You can dash away from an enemy even at the moment they attack. On a miss, your surroundings trip you up, and you’re caught in place while danger closes in.</span>
						<span class='forage'>When you <strong>travel or pass into a forest</strong>, before making any travel move, you can clear your choice of:
							<ul>
								<li>Up to 3-depletion</li>
								<li>Up to 2-exhaustion</li>
								<li>Up to 2-injury</li>
							</ul>
						</span>
						<span class='fealty'>When you <strong>commit yourself to the cause of someone you deem worthy</strong>, swear an oath to them stating what task you will complete on their behalf. Mark exhaustion to reroll a move made in pursuit of that task. You cannot commit yourself to another cause until you accomplish the first, or break your oath. If you break your oath, fill your exhaustion track and mark 4 notoriety with the faction whose trust you betrayed. If you fulfill your oath, mark 4 prestige with the faction whose trust you kept.</span>
						<span class='dd'>You’re at your luckiest when you go into danger without hesitation. When you <strong>dive into a dangerous situation without forethought or planning</strong>, treat yourself as having “Luck Armor,” with 1 box of wear (remember, armor is only “destroyed” when you would mark another box of wear, and all its boxes are full). The “Luck armor” automatically goes away once the danger has passed, and the next time you would have “Luck armor,” you gain it as if it was brand new with clear boxes.</span>
						<span class='smallhand'>When you <strong>grapple</strong> with an enemy larger than you, roll with Finesse instead of Might. On a miss, they overpower you—you’re at their mercy.</span>
						<span class='jury'>When you <strong>create a makeshift device on the fly</strong>, roll with Cunning. On a hit, you create a device that works once, then breaks. On a 10+, choose one:
							<ul>
								<li>It works exceptionally well</li>
								<li>You get an additional use out of it</li>
							</ul>
						On a miss, the device works, but it has an unintended side effect that the GM will reveal when you use it.</span>
						<span class='charm'>When you <strong>play upon an enemy’s insecurities, concerns, or fears to distract them with words during a fight</strong>, roll with Cunning. On a hit, you create an opening for yourself—make any available weapon move against them at +1, or strike quickly and deal injury to them. On a 7-9, you also tick them off; they aren’t listening to you anymore, no matter what you do, until the situation drastically changes. On a miss, you infuriate them—they come at you, hard, and you’re not prepared.</span>						
						<span class='read'>Take +1 Cunning (max +3).</span>
						<span class='draw'>When you <strong>target someone</strong> with a bow, mark wear on the bow to roll with Might. On a hit, mark exhaustion to inflict 1 additional injury. Mark exhaustion again to make your shot ignore the enemy’s armor—they cannot mark wear to absorb the injury.</span>
						<span class='travel'>When you <strong>travel along the paths to another clearing</strong>, you can always give +1 to the roll or clear 2-exhaustion, your choice. When you <strong>travel through the forest to another clearing</strong>, you can always give +1 to the roll or clear 2-depletion, your choice. In both cases, before you arrive at the next clearing, you can ask the GM any two questions about the next clearing, based on what you remember from your last time through.</span>
						<span class='threat'>When you <strong>persuade an NPC with open threats or naked steel</strong>, roll with Might instead of Charm.</span>
						<span class='rules'>When you <strong>call upon a reasonable foe to uphold a rule of war</strong>, roll with Might. On a hit, they feel obliged; choose one below they must follow. On a 7-9, they choose one that you must follow; disobey, and the obligation ends.
							<ul>
								<li>Show mercy to surrendering foes and prisoners</li>
								<li>Refrain from underhanded tactics in a fight</li>
								<li>Face each other without aid, back-up, or assistance</li>
								<li>Keep the violence away from the unarmed or innocent</li>
								<li>Fight to surrender or subdual, without retreat</li>
							</ul>
						On a miss, they feel no obligation to your ideas of war; prepare for a brutal lesson in the rules they adhere to.</span>
						<span class='danger'>You have a mask or outfit you wear when you go about your most destructive work—more of a calling card, an identifier of “the real you,” than a disguise. Treat it as a piece of equipment with two boxes of wear. While you have your mask on, any notoriety you gain is doubled, any prestige you gain is halved, and take +1 to <strong>trust fate</strong> and all Scoundrel playbook moves. If your mask is ever taken from you, mark exhaustion. If your mask is ever destroyed, mark 4-exhaustion. If your mask is destroyed, you can make a new mask when time passes.</span>
						<span class='thief'>Take +1 Finesse (max +3).</span>
						<span class='mind'>When you <strong>attempt roguish feats</strong> involving mechanisms or locks, mark depletion to roll with Cunning instead of Finesse.</span>
						<span class='play'>When you <strong>play a game of skill and wit to loosen another’s tongue</strong>, roll with Charm. On a hit, they let slip something useful or valuable. On a 7-9, you have to lose the game to get them there; mark one depletion. On a miss, they’re better than you ever thought; either mark one depletion and cut your losses, or mark three depletion and they’ll start talking.</span>						
						<span class='friends'>When you <strong>try to befriend an NPC you’ve just met by matching their personality, body language, and desires</strong>, mark exhaustion and roll with Cunning. On a hit, they’ll look upon you favorably—ask them any one noncompromising question and they’ll answer truthfully, or request a simple favor and they’ll do it for you. On a 10+, they really like you—they’ll share a valuable secret or grant you a serious favor instead. On a miss, you read them totally wrong, and their displeasure costs you.</span>
						<span class='guardian'>When you <strong>defend someone or something from an immediate NPC or environmental threat</strong>, roll with Might. On a hit, you keep them safe and choose one. On a 7–9, it costs: expose yourself to danger or escalate the situation.
							<ul>
								<li>Draw the attention of the threat; they focus on you now.</li>
								<li>Put the threat in a vulnerable spot; take +1 forward to counterstrike.</li>
								<li>Push the threat back; you and your protectee have a chance to maneuver or flee.</li>
							</ul>
						On a miss, you take the full brunt of the blow intended for your protectee, and the threat has you where it wants you.</span>
						<span class='smuggle'>You’ve got a good sense for finding secret paths and doors. When you <strong>spend time looking for a secret way in or out of a place that might have one</strong>, mark exhaustion and roll with Luck. On a hit, you find a hidden path—the GM will detail it and to where it leads. On a 10+, there’s something along or inside the path of value to you—the GM will tell you what. On a miss, you find a secret path...and someone else is using it right this second. They probably won’t be happy you found their secret.</span>
						<span class='fighter'>Take two of the following weapon skills: <i>Trick Shot, Confuse Senses, Improvise Weapon, Disarm, Vicious Strike</i>. None of the skills you take with this move count against your maximum for advancement.</span>
						<span class='watching'>Take +1 Cunning (max +3).</span>
						<span class='lucky'>When you <strong>use a weapon move</strong> (basic or skilled), mark exhaustion to roll with Luck instead of the listed stat.</span>
						<span class='goldnose'>When you <strong>figure someone out</strong>, you can always ask (even on a miss):
							<ul><li>what is the most valuable thing they are carrying?</li></ul>
							When you <strong>read a tense situation</strong>, you can always ask (even on a miss):
							<ul><li>what is the most valuable thing here?</li></ul>
						</span>
						<span class='dismantle'>When you <strong>dismantle a broken or disabled piece of equipment or machinery</strong>, clear 2 depletion boxes.</span>
						<span class='sand'>Take the weapon skill <i>Confuse Senses</i>. This does not count against the maximum number of weapon skills you can take. When you <strong>throw something to confuse an opponent’s senses at close or intimate range</strong>, roll with Cunning instead of Finesse.</span>

							On a miss, they twist your message in unpredictable ways.
						</span>
						<span class='hardy'>Take 1 additional injury boxes. Whenever time passes or you journey to a new clearing, you can clear 2 injury boxes automatically.</span>
						<span class='parkour'>When you <strong>dash your way through a chaotic scene or fight</strong>, roll with Finesse. On a 10+, hold 3. On a 7-9, hold 2. Spend your hold 1-for-1 to dash to something within sight and reach without being stopped, or to dash away from something nearby without being stopped. You can dash away from an enemy even at the moment they attack. On a miss, your surroundings trip you up, and you’re caught in place while danger closes in.</span>
						<span class='forage'>When you <strong>travel or pass into a forest</strong>, before making any travel move, you can clear your choice of:
							<ul>
								<li>Up to 3-depletion</li>
								<li>Up to 2-exhaustion</li>
								<li>Up to 2-injury</li>
							</ul>
						</span>
						<span class='fealty'>When you <strong>commit yourself to the cause of someone you deem worthy</strong>, swear an oath to them stating what task you will complete on their behalf. Mark exhaustion to reroll a move made in pursuit of that task. You cannot commit yourself to another cause until you accomplish the first, or break your oath. If you break your oath, fill your exhaustion track and mark 4 notoriety with the faction whose trust you betrayed. If you fulfill your oath, mark 4 prestige with the faction whose trust you kept.</span>
						<span class='dd'>You’re at your luckiest when you go into danger without hesitation. When you <strong>dive into a dangerous situation without forethought or planning</strong>, treat yourself as having “Luck Armor,” with 1 box of wear (remember, armor is only “destroyed” when you would mark another box of wear, and all its boxes are full). The “Luck armor” automatically goes away once the danger has passed, and the next time you would have “Luck armor,” you gain it as if it was brand new with clear boxes.</span>
						<span class='smallhand'>When you <strong>grapple</strong> with an enemy larger than you, roll with Finesse instead of Might. On a miss, they overpower you—you’re at their mercy.</span>
						<span class='jury'>When you <strong>create a makeshift device on the fly</strong>, roll with Cunning. On a hit, you create a device that works once, then breaks. On a 10+, choose one:
							<ul>
								<li>It works exceptionally well</li>
								<li>You get an additional use out of it</li>
							</ul>
						On a miss, the device works, but it has an unintended side effect that the GM will reveal when you use it.</span>
						<span class='charm'>When you <strong>play upon an enemy’s insecurities, concerns, or fears to distract them with words during a fight</strong>, roll with Cunning. On a hit, you create an opening for yourself—make any available weapon move against them at +1, or strike quickly and deal injury to them. On a 7-9, you also tick them off; they aren’t listening to you anymore, no matter what you do, until the situation drastically changes. On a miss, you infuriate them—they come at you, hard, and you’re not prepared.</span>						
						<span class='read'>Take +1 Cunning (max +3).</span>
						<span class='draw'>When you <strong>target someone</strong> with a bow, mark wear on the bow to roll with Might. On a hit, mark exhaustion to inflict 1 additional injury. Mark exhaustion again to make your shot ignore the enemy’s armor—they cannot mark wear to absorb the injury.</span>
						<span class='travel'>When you <strong>travel along the paths to another clearing</strong>, you can always give +1 to the roll or clear 2-exhaustion, your choice. When you <strong>travel through the forest to another clearing</strong>, you can always give +1 to the roll or clear 2-depletion, your choice. In both cases, before you arrive at the next clearing, you can ask the GM any two questions about the next clearing, based on what you remember from your last time through.</span>
						<span class='threat'>When you <strong>persuade an NPC with open threats or naked steel</strong>, roll with Might instead of Charm.</span>
						<span class='rules'>When you <strong>call upon a reasonable foe to uphold a rule of war</strong>, roll with Might. On a hit, they feel obliged; choose one below they must follow. On a 7-9, they choose one that you must follow; disobey, and the obligation ends.
							<ul>
								<li>Show mercy to surrendering foes and prisoners</li>
								<li>Refrain from underhanded tactics in a fight</li>
								<li>Face each other without aid, back-up, or assistance</li>
								<li>Keep the violence away from the unarmed or innocent</li>
								<li>Fight to surrender or subdual, without retreat</li>
							</ul>
						On a miss, they feel no obligation to your ideas of war; prepare for a brutal lesson in the rules they adhere to.</span>
						<span class='danger'>You have a mask or outfit you wear when you go about your most destructive work—more of a calling card, an identifier of “the real you,” than a disguise. Treat it as a piece of equipment with two boxes of wear. While you have your mask on, any notoriety you gain is doubled, any prestige you gain is halved, and take +1 to <strong>trust fate</strong> and all Scoundrel playbook moves. If your mask is ever taken from you, mark exhaustion. If your mask is ever destroyed, mark 4-exhaustion. If your mask is destroyed, you can make a new mask when time passes.</span>
						<span class='thief'>Take +1 Finesse (max +3).</span>
						<span class='mind'>When you <strong>attempt roguish feats</strong> involving mechanisms or locks, mark depletion to roll with Cunning instead of Finesse.</span>
						<span class='play'>When you <strong>play a game of skill and wit to loosen another’s tongue</strong>, roll with Charm. On a hit, they let slip something useful or valuable. On a 7-9, you have to lose the game to get them there; mark one depletion. On a miss, they’re better than you ever thought; either mark one depletion and cut your losses, or mark three depletion and they’ll start talking.</span>						
						<span class='friends'>When you <strong>try to befriend an NPC you’ve just met by matching their personality, body language, and desires</strong>, mark exhaustion and roll with Cunning. On a hit, they’ll look upon you favorably—ask them any one noncompromising question and they’ll answer truthfully, or request a simple favor and they’ll do it for you. On a 10+, they really like you—they’ll share a valuable secret or grant you a serious favor instead. On a miss, you read them totally wrong, and their displeasure costs you.</span>
						<span class='guardian'>When you <strong>defend someone or something from an immediate NPC or environmental threat</strong>, roll with Might. On a hit, you keep them safe and choose one. On a 7–9, it costs: expose yourself to danger or escalate the situation.
							<ul>
								<li>Draw the attention of the threat; they focus on you now.</li>
								<li>Put the threat in a vulnerable spot; take +1 forward to counterstrike.</li>
								<li>Push the threat back; you and your protectee have a chance to maneuver or flee.</li>
							</ul>
						On a miss, you take the full brunt of the blow intended for your protectee, and the threat has you where it wants you.</span>
						<span class='smuggle'>You’ve got a good sense for finding secret paths and doors. When you <strong>spend time looking for a secret way in or out of a place that might have one</strong>, mark exhaustion and roll with Luck. On a hit, you find a hidden path—the GM will detail it and to where it leads. On a 10+, there’s something along or inside the path of value to you—the GM will tell you what. On a miss, you find a secret path...and someone else is using it right this second. They probably won’t be happy you found their secret.</span>
						<span class='fighter'>Take two of the following weapon skills: <i>Trick Shot, Confuse Senses, Improvise Weapon, Disarm, Vicious Strike</i>. None of the skills you take with this move count against your maximum for advancement.</span>
						<span class='watching'>Take +1 Cunning (max +3).</span>
						<span class='lucky'>When you <strong>use a weapon move</strong> (basic or skilled), mark exhaustion to roll with Luck instead of the listed stat.</span>
						<span class='goldnose'>When you <strong>figure someone out</strong>, you can always ask (even on a miss):
							<ul><li>what is the most valuable thing they are carrying?</li></ul>
							When you <strong>read a tense situation</strong>, you can always ask (even on a miss):
							<ul><li>what is the most valuable thing here?</li></ul>
						</span>
						<span class='dismantle'>When you <strong>dismantle a broken or disabled piece of equipment or machinery</strong>, clear 2 depletion boxes.</span>
						<span class='sand'>Take the weapon skill <i>Confuse Senses</i>. This does not count against the maximum number of weapon skills you can take. When you <strong>throw something to confuse an opponent’s senses at close or intimate range</strong>, roll with Cunning instead of Finesse.</span>
